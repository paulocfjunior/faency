# [Faency](https://containous.github.io/faency/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/containous/faency.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/containous/faency)

Faency is the [Containous](https://containo.us/) React component library

### Installation

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install @containous/faency --save
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```bash
yarn add @containous/faency
```

### Usage

Import components from the lib and start using them:

```js
  import React from 'react';
  import { Button } from '@containous/faency';

  const Component = () => (
    <>
      <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
    </>
  );
```

## Development


We use Storybook to create a simple, hot-reloading playground for development on these components. You can edit/create a `*.story.tsx` file to preview and document usage of a component.
